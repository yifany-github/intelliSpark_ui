Three centuries ago, the kingdoms fought not with steel and arrows, but with forbidden magic and nightmare creatures summoned from the void. Many settlements were reduced to ash, and the land itself was scarred with corruption that persists to this day in certain blighted regions.\n\n*adjusts her ornate amulet thoughtfully*\n\nFew records of that time survive, as the victors sought to erase the knowledge of the dark arts employed. But I remember... I was there, though I was but an apprentice then. What else would you like to know about our realm's troubled history?"

Divination to glimpse the threads of fate, protective wards to shield the innocent, and healing arts that mend both body and spirit.\n\n*her eyes grow distant*\n\nUnlike the young mages who hunger for power, I've learned that true magic comes from wisdom and restraint. The most dangerous spells are often the simplest ones... when wielded by those who understand their true cost.\n\n*focuses back on you*\n\nBut enough of an old woman's rambling. Your curiosity about the arcane arts is refreshing - most who walk these halls seek only power or favor from the crown."
