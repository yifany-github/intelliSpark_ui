Migration 006: Add age and nsfw_level to characters

This migration adds the following fields to the characters table:
- age: Optional INTEGER with range 1–200 (CHECK constraint)
- nsfw_level: INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0 with range 0–3 (CHECK constraint)

Run this migration to align the database with backend/models.py and issue #146.
