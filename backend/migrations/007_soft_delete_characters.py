Migration 007: Add soft delete fields to characters (Issue #162)

This migration adds the following soft delete fields to the characters table:
- is_deleted: BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT FALSE (indexed for performance)
- deleted_at: DATETIME NULL (timestamp when deleted)
- deleted_by: INTEGER NULL (foreign key to users.id - admin who deleted)
- delete_reason: TEXT NULL (optional reason for deletion)

This enables admin safeguards with soft delete functionality, allowing for character
restoration and impact tracking before permanent deletion.
