# Feature Specification: Chat Stability and Error Recovery

**Feature Branch**: `003-fix-chat-stability`
**Created**: 2025-01-17
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "I am facing some bug for the current system, like in the chat/ sometimes errors like this appear: Failed to generate AI response 400: AI response generation failed: (sqlalchemy.dialects.postgresql.asyncpg.ProgrammingError) <class 'asyncpg.exceptions.DuplicatePreparedStatementError'>: prepared statement \"__asyncpg_stmt_17__\" already exists. The error mentions pgbouncer with pool_mode set to transaction or statement does not support prepared statements properly, and suggests setting statement_cache_size to 0 when creating the asyncpg connection object. Also, I will sometimes get '加载错误' in the chat/, and sometimes I am stuck at 'xx正在输入。。' until I refresh. The refresh usually has high chance to have the db err, '加载错误' or 'xx正在输入。。' resolve, but sometimes have significant delay on displaying on '最近聊天'"

## User Scenarios & Testing

### User Story 1 - Reliable AI Message Generation (Priority: P1)

Users expect AI responses to be generated consistently without database-related errors, even under load with connection pooling enabled.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality of the chat application. Without reliable AI message generation, the entire application is unusable. The PostgreSQL prepared statement errors are blocking critical user workflows.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by sending messages to AI characters in the chat interface and verifying that responses are generated without database errors, delivers immediate value by restoring core functionality.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user is chatting with an AI character, **When** they send a message, **Then** the AI response is generated successfully without "DuplicatePreparedStatementError"
2. **Given** the system is using pgBouncer in transaction or statement pooling mode, **When** multiple users send concurrent messages, **Then** all AI responses are generated without prepared statement conflicts
3. **Given** a message generation request, **When** a database error occurs, **Then** the system retries automatically with exponential backoff before showing an error to the user

### User Story 2 - Graceful Error Display and Recovery (Priority: P1)

When errors do occur, users see clear, actionable error messages in their preferred language (Chinese/English) and can recover without losing their conversation context or needing to refresh the page.

**Why this priority**: Poor error handling creates frustration and makes users lose trust in the application. The generic '加载错误' (Loading Error) message provides no guidance for recovery, and forced page refreshes interrupt user flow.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested independently by simulating various error conditions (network failures, timeout, server errors) and verifying error messages are displayed correctly and recovery actions work.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an AI message generation fails, **When** the error occurs, **Then** the user sees a specific, actionable error message in their selected language (not generic '加载错误')
2. **Given** an error is displayed, **When** the user clicks a retry button, **Then** the system attempts to regenerate the response without requiring a page refresh
3. **Given** a conversation with an error, **When** the user recovers from the error, **Then** the conversation history and context are preserved
4. **Given** multiple consecutive errors, **When** automatic retries fail, **Then** the user sees options to refresh only the chat component (not the entire page) or report the issue

---

### User Story 3 - Accurate Typing Indicators (Priority: P2)

Users see accurate real-time feedback when the AI is processing their message, with typing indicators ('xx正在输入...') that automatically clear when the response is ready or when an error occurs.

**Why this priority**: Stuck typing indicators create confusion about system state and force unnecessary page refreshes. This affects perceived performance and user trust, but doesn't block core functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested independently by monitoring typing indicator state during message sending, response generation, and error scenarios without affecting other chat features.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user sends a message, **When** the AI starts processing, **Then** the typing indicator appears within 100ms
2. **Given** the AI is processing a message, **When** the response is received, **Then** the typing indicator disappears immediately
3. **Given** the AI is processing a message, **When** an error occurs, **Then** the typing indicator disappears and is replaced with an error state within 200ms
4. **Given** a typing indicator is showing, **When** the user waits for maximum generation timeout (30 seconds), **Then** the indicator automatically clears with an appropriate timeout message

---

### User Story 4 - Responsive Recent Chats List (Priority: P3)

The recent chats list ('最近聊天') updates immediately when users send messages, receive responses, or create new chats, without significant delays or requiring page refreshes.

**Why this priority**: Delayed updates to the chat list affect navigation and discoverability but don't prevent core messaging functionality. This is an optimization that improves polish and perceived performance.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested independently by monitoring the recent chats list update latency after various chat actions (new message, new chat, character interaction).

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user sends a message in an existing chat, **When** the message is sent, **Then** the chat moves to the top of the recent chats list within 500ms
2. **Given** a user creates a new chat, **When** the first message is sent, **Then** the new chat appears in the recent chats list within 500ms
3. **Given** multiple browser tabs are open, **When** a chat is updated in one tab, **Then** the recent chats list in other tabs updates within 2 seconds
4. **Given** the recent chats list is loading, **When** the data is being fetched, **Then** a skeleton loading state is shown (not '加载错误' on first load)

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the database connection pool is exhausted during peak usage?
- How does the system handle network disconnections during message generation?
- What happens if pgBouncer configuration cannot be changed and statement_cache_size must remain at default?
- How does the system recover when a message generation times out after 30 seconds?
- What happens when a user rapidly sends multiple messages before the AI responds to the first one?
- How does error state synchronize across multiple browser tabs viewing the same chat?
- What happens when a refresh is triggered during an active AI response generation?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST configure asyncpg connection with `statement_cache_size=0` when pgBouncer is detected or configured
- **FR-002**: System MUST implement automatic retry logic with exponential backoff (3 retries: 1s, 2s, 4s) for database errors during message generation
- **FR-003**: System MUST display specific, localized error messages for different failure types (database error, network error, timeout, rate limit) instead of generic '加载错误'
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide in-component retry actions that do not require full page refresh
- **FR-005**: System MUST clear typing indicators within 200ms when message generation completes, fails, or times out
- **FR-006**: System MUST implement timeout for AI message generation (30 seconds maximum) with automatic cleanup of typing indicators
- **FR-007**: System MUST preserve conversation context and history when errors occur and are recovered
- **FR-008**: System MUST update recent chats list optimistically (immediate UI update) with rollback on error
- **FR-009**: System MUST implement proper cleanup of in-flight requests when component unmounts or user navigates away
- **FR-010**: System MUST log detailed error context (error type, stack trace, user ID, chat ID, character ID) for debugging without exposing sensitive details to users
- **FR-011**: System MUST detect pgBouncer connection strings in DATABASE_URL and automatically apply appropriate connection parameters
- **FR-012**: System MUST implement circuit breaker pattern for AI generation endpoint to prevent cascading failures (open circuit after 5 consecutive failures, half-open after 30 seconds)

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR-001**: Error messages MUST be displayed within 300ms of error detection
- **NFR-002**: Retry operations MUST not block the UI thread or prevent other user interactions
- **NFR-003**: Recent chats list updates MUST complete within 500ms under normal load (< 100 active chats)
- **NFR-004**: System MUST handle at least 50 concurrent message generations without database connection errors
- **NFR-005**: Error recovery mechanisms MUST not cause memory leaks in long-running sessions (> 1 hour)

### Key Entities

- **Error State**: Represents the current error condition in the chat UI, including error type, message key for i18n, retry callback, and timestamp
- **Typing Indicator State**: Tracks which characters are currently "typing" across all active chats, with automatic cleanup timers
- **Message Generation Request**: Represents an in-flight AI generation request with retry count, timeout handle, and cancellation token
- **Connection Pool Configuration**: Database connection settings including statement_cache_size, pooling mode detection, and pgBouncer compatibility flags

## Assumptions

- The production environment uses PostgreSQL with pgBouncer in transaction or statement pooling mode
- The system has access to modify asyncpg connection parameters in the backend
- Users primarily use modern browsers with JavaScript enabled
- The Gemini AI service has consistent response times averaging 2-5 seconds
- Network latency between frontend and backend is typically < 200ms
- The existing error logging infrastructure can capture detailed error context
- Users have reasonable expectations for AI response times (< 30 seconds)
- The TanStack Query library is already configured for the chat interface

## Out of Scope

- Migrating away from pgBouncer to native asyncpg connection pooling (architectural change)

- Adding real-time collaborative features or live typing indicators for multiple users
- Optimizing AI model performance or reducing generation latency
- Implementing server-sent events (SSE) or WebSocket connections for real-time updates
- Adding comprehensive telemetry dashboard for error monitoring (can use existing logs)
- Refactoring the entire chat architecture or state management approach
- Adding unit tests or integration tests (per constitution principle V: Pragmatic Testing)

## Dependencies

- Backend must be able to detect pgBouncer connection strings in DATABASE_URL
- Frontend i18n system must support new error message keys
- TanStack Query configuration must support custom retry logic and optimistic updates
- Error logging service must be available and properly configured
