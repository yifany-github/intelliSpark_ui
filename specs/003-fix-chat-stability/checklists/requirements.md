# Specification Quality Checklist: Chat Stability and Error Recovery

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-01-17
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes

**Strengths:**
- All 4 user stories are well-prioritized with clear independent test criteria
- Comprehensive edge cases covering database pool exhaustion, network failures, and multi-tab scenarios
- Success criteria are specific and measurable (99.5% success rate, 200ms timing requirements)
- Clear functional requirements addressing both database pooling (FR-001, FR-011) and UI error handling (FR-003, FR-004, FR-005)
- Appropriate assumptions documented (pgBouncer usage, browser capabilities, AI response times)

**Minor Notes:**
- Some FRs reference technical concepts (asyncpg, pgBouncer, circuit breaker) but these are necessary to specify the database issue being fixed
- Success criteria include specific metrics (99.5%, 200ms, 500ms) which are measurable and appropriate for stability requirements
- No implementation guidance provided (correctly deferred to planning phase)

## Status

**PASS** - All checklist items validated. Specification is ready for `/speckit.tasks` or `/speckit.plan`.
